# Python Mini Projects 2025
This repository contains seven beginner-friendly Python projects.

## Why This Repository?
Everyone starts small.  
This repo documents my journey of building consistency, logic, and coding confidence through simple hands-on Python projects.

1. Daily structured practice  
2. Core logic over complexity  
3. Understanding fundamentals  
4. Building discipline through small steps
   
## What’s Inside?

### Command-Line Projects (5 Projects)
Simple logic-based programs built with loops, conditionals, and functions.

- Hangman  
- Number Guessing  
- Tic Tac Toe  
- Rock Paper Scissors (CLI)  
- Dice Roller  

### Utility Projects (2 Projects)
Small tools to practice string handling, randomness, and basic algorithms.

- Password Generator  
- Quiz Game  

## Project Goal
To strengthen Python basics through short, self-contained scripts focusing on clarity, problem-solving, and clean structure rather than complexity.

## Key Learnings
1. Improved understanding of Python fundamentals  
2. Learned to break problems into smaller steps  
3. Became more comfortable with writing clean scripts  
4. Practiced logical thinking and flow control  
5. Realised: Progress = small consistent steps
